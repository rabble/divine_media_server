# Blossom Audit Results

## Audit Tool

Using `blossom-audit` CLI tool version 0.2.2:
```bash
npx blossom-audit audit http://localhost:8787 bitcoin --verbose
```

## Results Summary

### ‚úÖ Passing Tests
- CORS preflight OPTIONS request returns 204
- Access-Control-Allow-Origin includes wildcard "*"
- Access-Control-Allow-Headers includes "Authorization"
- Access-Control-Allow-Methods includes "GET", "PUT", "DELETE"
- Access-Control-Max-Age is 86400

### ‚ùå Issues Found

#### Critical (Must Fix)
None - server is functional

#### Recommended Improvements

1. **Missing X-Reason header on error responses**
   - Location: Error responses (401, 404, etc.)
   - BUD Reference: https://github.com/hzrd149/blossom/blob/master/buds/01.md#error-responses
   - Fix: Add `X-Reason` header with human-readable error message

2. **Access-Control-Allow-Headers should include wildcard**
   - Location: OPTIONS /upload response
   - BUD Reference: https://github.com/hzrd149/blossom/blob/master/buds/01.md#cross-origin-headers
   - Current: `Authorization, Content-Type`
   - Recommended: `*` (or keep specific headers)

3. **Missing WWW-Authenticate header on 401**
   - Location: 401 Unauthorized responses
   - Standard: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/WWW-Authenticate
   - Fix: Add `WWW-Authenticate: Nostr`

4. **Missing Access-Control-Expose-Headers**
   - Location: All responses
   - Purpose: Allow browser clients to access custom response headers
   - Recommended: `Access-Control-Expose-Headers: *`

### üîµ Optional Features Not Implemented

1. **BUD-06: Upload Check Endpoint**
   - HEAD /upload with X-Content-Length, X-Content-Type, X-SHA-256
   - Purpose: Check if blob exists before uploading
   - Status: Not implemented (optional feature)

## Audit Notes

### Why Audit Failed
The full audit requires authentication to test upload/download cycles. The worker was tested without providing a Nostr private key (`--sec` flag), so it correctly returned 401 Unauthorized.

### What Was Tested
1. ‚úÖ CORS preflight (OPTIONS)
2. ‚úÖ Upload check endpoint (BUD-06, optional)
3. ‚úÖ Upload without authentication (correctly returns 401)
4. ‚ùå Upload with authentication (not tested, requires --sec flag)
5. ‚ùå Download (not tested, requires successful upload first)

### Full Test with Authentication

To run a complete audit with authentication:
```bash
# Generate a test key
npx nak key generate

# Run audit with private key
npx blossom-audit audit http://localhost:8787 bitcoin --sec nsec1...
```

## Recommendations

### High Priority
1. Add `X-Reason` header to all error responses
2. Add `WWW-Authenticate: Nostr` header to 401 responses

### Medium Priority
3. Add `Access-Control-Expose-Headers: *` to all responses
4. Consider implementing BUD-06 upload check endpoint

### Low Priority
5. Consider allowing wildcard in `Access-Control-Allow-Headers`

## Comparison with Existing Worker

Both workers (main and SDK) have similar CORS and error handling patterns. These improvements should be applied to both implementations.

## Next Steps

1. Create issues for each recommended improvement
2. Implement fixes in priority order
3. Re-run audit after fixes
4. Test with authentication using --sec flag
5. Verify download audits pass after upload works
