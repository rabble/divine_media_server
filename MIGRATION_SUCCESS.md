# ✅ Migration Success!

## Working Migration Example

Successfully migrated video from api.openvine.co to Cloudflare Stream:

- **Source**: `https://api.openvine.co/media/1`
- **Stream UID**: `b475c26f0dd41eef96b90eb0ef9ea309`
- **Direct Stream URL**: `https://customer-4c3uhd5qzuhwz9hu.cloudflarestream.com/b475c26f0dd41eef96b90eb0ef9ea309/manifest/video.m3u8` (✅ Working)
- **CDN URL**: `https://cdn.divine.video/b475c26f0dd41eef96b90eb0ef9ea309/manifest/video.m3u8` (⚠️ CDN proxy returns 500)

## Migration Command That Works

```bash
curl -X POST "https://cf-stream-service-prod.protestnet.workers.dev/v1/openvine/migrate" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer 823d4485677c393b51fbb8555b8f5d39777e266c22e30b4190586f701eea5a8c" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "videoId": "1",
    "vineId": "test_openvine_media_1"
  }'
```

## What's Working

✅ **Migration Process**:
- Videos successfully copy from api.openvine.co to Cloudflare Stream
- Stream creates the video with proper UID
- Video is playable directly from Stream URLs

✅ **Stream Infrastructure**:
- Videos are stored in Cloudflare Stream
- HLS manifests are generated
- Direct Stream URLs work perfectly

## Issues to Fix

⚠️ **CDN Proxy** (cdn.divine.video):
- Returns 500 error when accessing migrated videos
- Might need to check the CDN proxy worker configuration

⚠️ **KV Storage**:
- Migration records don't seem to be stored in KV
- Lookup by vineId returns "not_found"

## Next Steps

1. **Fix CDN Proxy Worker**: Debug why cdn.divine.video returns 500
2. **Fix KV Storage**: Ensure migration records are stored properly
3. **Find More Videos**: Get list of actual video IDs from api.openvine.co
4. **Scale Up**: Once issues are fixed, migrate the 150k videos

## How to Find Real Video IDs

Since api.openvine.co/media/{id} works with numeric IDs, try:
- Sequential IDs: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5...
- Check your OpenVine database for actual file IDs
- Use NIP-98 auth to access the media list endpoint

## Test More Videos

```bash
# Try sequential IDs
for i in {1..10}; do
  echo "Testing /media/$i..."
  curl -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}\n" "https://api.openvine.co/media/$i"
done
```
