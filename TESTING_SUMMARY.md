# Testing Summary - Divine Video CDN Setup

## ‚úÖ What's Working

### 1. DNS Configuration
- All 4 CNAME records are configured
- DNS is resolving correctly
- Proxy disabled for R2 domains (gray cloud)

### 2. R2 Public Access
- Bucket is public: `https://pub-9aabd5174f254ffba8cacfee9ef11a89.r2.dev`
- 317,660 objects accessible
- Direct R2 URL works: `https://pub-9aabd5174f254ffba8cacfee9ef11a89.r2.dev/uploads/1750591730308-13cdc4ee.mp4`

### 3. Workers Deployed
- Main service: `https://cf-stream-service-prod.protestnet.workers.dev`
- CDN proxy: Active on `cdn.divine.video/*` and `cdn-staging.divine.video/*`

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Issues to Resolve

### 1. R2 Custom Domain (r2.divine.video)
- Getting 403 Forbidden
- DNS is correct but something is blocking
- **Solution**: May need to wait for DNS propagation or add domain via Cloudflare R2 settings

### 2. Stream CDN Testing
- Need a real Stream video UID to test
- Migration endpoint getting Stream API errors
- **Solution**: Need to ensure STREAM_API_TOKEN is properly configured

## üß™ How to Test Once Everything Works

### Test R2 Domain:
```bash
# Should work once DNS fully propagates
curl -I https://r2.divine.video/uploads/1750591730308-13cdc4ee.mp4
```

### Test Stream CDN:
```bash
# Replace {UID} with a real Stream video UID
curl -I https://cdn.divine.video/{UID}/manifest/video.m3u8
```

### Get Stream Video UID:
1. Go to Cloudflare Dashboard ‚Üí Stream
2. Click on any video (like test-video.mp4)
3. Copy the UID from the video details
4. Test with: `https://cdn.divine.video/{UID}/manifest/video.m3u8`

                    cdn.divine.video
```

## üöÄ Ready for Migration

Once you have:
1. A working Stream API token configured
2. R2 custom domain working (or just use direct R2 URL)

You can migrate your 150k videos using:
```bash
curl -X POST https://cf-stream-service-prod.protestnet.workers.dev/v1/r2/migrate-batch \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_MIGRATION_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"prefix": "uploads/", "limit": 100}'
```

## Summary

**The CDN proxy is deployed and will work** once you have videos in Stream. To verify:
1. Get a video UID from your Stream dashboard
2. Test: `https://cdn.divine.video/{UID}/manifest/video.m3u8`

The system is ready - just needs:
- Stream API token properly configured for migrations
- Or manually upload a test video through Stream dashboard to get a UID for testing
